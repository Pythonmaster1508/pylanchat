FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

================================================================================

Q: I just want to connect to a server and chat, what do I need?

	You will only need to copy the Client directory and 
	its contents. And run the Client.py file.

Q: How do I run .py files in Windows?
		
	Click 'Start', click 'Run', type 'cmd' and hit enter. 
	A terminal will open. You will need to navigate to the 
	directory where the .py file is located. For example, 
	if you want to open C:\python\PLC\Client\Client.py 
	you will need to type 'cd c:\python\PLC\Client' to enter
	the directory. Once you there type 'python.exe Client.py' 
	and the .py should be running

Q: How do I run .py files in Linux?

	Open a terminal, navigate to the directory and run the 
	.py file by typing ./Client.py (for instance). 
	On most distros	you could also doubleclick the file 
	and it will ask you to run it.

Q: I'm running the .py file but I'm getting an error?

	You need to have Python, GTK+, Twisted and the Crypto 
	library installed to properly run Python LAN Chat. 
	On a lot of Linux distributions these packages are 
	installed by default or to be found in the package manager, 
	but on Windows they aren't. You can see INSTALL.txt for 
	more details. If you still receive errors, but have these 
	programs installed create a new issue on the issue tracker.

Q: How do I setup Python LAN Chat on my own local network?

	Pick a PC that will run the server. Copy the server 
	directory and run pylanchatd. Your channel will now 
	become available to other computers in your LAN with the 
	Python LAN Chat client (simply copy the
	Client directory and run Client.py). 
	You can also check out some minimal stats by pointing 
	your browser at	port 8080 of the server.
